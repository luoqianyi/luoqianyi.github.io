### 自我介绍（long）

🌈（自己整理）

Hello, Professors! It's my honor to be here for this interview.（开场白）

First let me introduce myself. My name is WuGenQiang, GengQiang in Chinese, means success. Maybe my parents want me to be successful in life and career. I hope this name can bring me good luck today. I have finished my undergraduate education in JinLing institute of technology, majoring in Software engineering in the college.（姓名，毕业院校，毕业专业，毕业学院）

I am open-minded, willing and have broad interests like table tennis, reading and especially in engineering such as software programming, website design. For example, during the past four years, I have accomplished two websites, Furthermore, I am interested in Java programming language and have written some application programs. In  July in the last year, I finished my graduate project with EnjoyToShare System, which was a mini program about sharing.（性格，爱好，实践经验）

Although I have broad interests in many aspects and grasp the essential knowledge of the major, but I think at present I can do many things in a superficial level, but not be competent to do things professionally owing to lack of ample knowledge and ability, so I think further study is still urgent for me to realize self-value.（为什么要读研）

The major that I hope pursue for my further education is artificial intelligence. Because I find it is playing a more and more important role in our modern society, And nowadays in china, with the recognition by the government, our domestic industry is growing rapidly and that may provide a lot of chances to us.（将来从事的方向）

I plan to concentrate on study and research in this field in my graduate time. And I hope I can form a systematic view of  artificial intelligence and make a solid foudation for future profession after three years study here.（读研时期的计划）

Ok, that's all. Thank you very much.（结束语）

Second, I often feel upset when I am busy. However, after four years' studying in college, I improved myself a lot.

I hope I can perform well in this interview, go on to another stage in my life and overcome my weaknesses eventually.

As far as I am concerned, I have fully prepared for the upcoming examination.
* Can you tell us something about COVID-19(Corona Virus Disease 2019)?
  * Since the outbreak of an infectious disease in wuhan in December 2019, the Chinese government has decisively closed down the city to prevent the spread of the disease. At the same time, although cases have been found throughout the country, the Chinese people actively face it, together with wuhan to fight the epidemic. 
  * At this particular time, we should go out as little as possible, isolated. If we go out, we must wear protective masks to prevent ourselves from getting infected. In addition, we should keep good healthy habits and keep our body clean.
  * As many Chinese say, “come on, Wuhan”, we believe we can certainly overcome the epidemic!

### 例题讲解

#### 远程教育

* What do you think of the distance-learning programs?
  * （第一段）I think distance-learning program is a new and effective educational pattern.（定义法）
  * （第二段）First, it increases one's opportunity of being educated, especially those with limited mobility, such as the elderly, the disabled and the injured, and also those with an irregular work schedule. For example,（举例法）some individuals who do really have jobs or take care of babies find that they can do their own things and study at the same time. Second, through distance-learning, students can communicate and interact with other students all over the country or even the world. As a result, information and knowledge can be shared. Third, distance-learning allows you to learn at your own pace. In a classroom, when everyone is taught together, it is often difficult to keep all students on the same page. This is where distance learning has an advantage over regular courses. Since you are given all course work beforehand, you can study as much or as little as you want every day, as long as you complete your study materials in time.
